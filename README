VCResponseFetcher

A very lightweight library for processing different types of GET response.
After receiving every GET response of the HTTP request we need to process it depending on the type of the data, say text, image, xml, json etc.
This is a generic library so we can add new custom processors for as many types of different types of responses we need.

All you need to do is get started with predefined processors i.e. VCDataResponseProcessor and VCImageResponseProcessor.

Example code of how to use this library is here.
